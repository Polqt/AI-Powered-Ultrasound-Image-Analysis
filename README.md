# AI-Powered Ultrasound Image Analysis

An end-to-end machine learning project for automatically detecting and localizing fetal anatomical structures in ultrasound images using state-of-the-art computer vision models.

> **Note**: This project is based on a DataCamp code-along tutorial for learning AI-powered medical image analysis. It serves as an educational implementation demonstrating real-world applications of computer vision in healthcare.

## Description

This project implements an AI-powered solution for ultrasound image analysis, specifically focused on detecting key fetal anatomical structures during prenatal examinations. Using Facebook's DETR (Detection Transformer) model from Hugging Face, the system can automatically identify and localize critical fetal structures including:

- **Abdomen**: Fetal abdominal circumference for growth assessment
- **Brain**: Fetal head circumference for gestational age estimation
- **Femur**: Femur length measurements for skeletal development
- **Thorax**: Chest circumference for cardiovascular assessment

### Key Features

- **Automated Detection**: Automatically identifies fetal anatomical structures in ultrasound images
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast inference using pre-trained transformer models
- **Clinical Relevance**: Focuses on medically important structures for prenatal care
- **Low-Resource Friendly**: Designed to assist healthcare providers in resource-limited settings
- **Educational**: Complete tutorial implementation with visualization tools
- **DataCamp-based**: Following structured learning path from DataCamp's AI curriculum

### Technical Approach

The project leverages the DETR (Detection Transformer) architecture, which uses:
- **Transformer-based object detection**: End-to-end detection without traditional anchor boxes
- **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on ultrasound-specific data
- **Bounding box regression**: Precise localization of anatomical structures
- **Multi-class classification**: Simultaneous detection of multiple structure types

### Medical Context

Fetal ultrasound is the gold standard for monitoring fetal development and ensuring timely clinical interventions in antenatal care. This AI system can assist healthcare providers by:
- Reducing examination time
- Providing consistent measurements
- Supporting less experienced operators
- Enabling quality care in low-resource settings

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Polqt/AI-Powered-Ultrasound-Image-Analysis.git
   cd AI-Powered-Ultrasound-Image-Analysis
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv ultrasound_env
   source ultrasound_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ultrasound_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   pip install transformers datasets
   pip install pillow matplotlib
   pip install numpy pandas
   pip install jupyter
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**
   The dataset contains ultrasound images and corresponding annotations. Download from the provided Google Drive link in the notebook or prepare your own dataset following the same structure:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train_dataset/
   │   ├── *.png (ultrasound images)
   │   └── train_annotations.json
   └── test_dataset/
       ├── *.png (ultrasound images)
       └── test_annotations.json
   ```

### Dataset Structure

Each annotation file contains JSON objects with:
- `label`: Structure type (abdomen, brain, femur, thorax)
- `bbox`: Bounding box coordinates [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
- `image_filename`: Corresponding image file

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `notebook.ipynb`** and follow the step-by-step tutorial

### Key Workflow Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load ultrasound images and annotations
   - Transform data for DETR model input
   - Visualize dataset samples

2. **Model Setup:**
   - Load pre-trained DETR model from Hugging Face
   - Configure for ultrasound-specific classes
   - Set up image processor

3. **Training:**
   - Fine-tune the model on ultrasound data
   - Monitor training progress
   - Save checkpoints

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Test model performance on validation set
   - Visualize predictions vs ground truth
   - Calculate precision metrics

5. **Inference:**
   - Load trained model
   - Process new ultrasound images
   - Visualize detection results

### Example Usage

```python
# Load trained model
from transformers import DetrForObjectDetection, DetrImageProcessor

model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("detr-ultrasound/checkpoint-25")
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("detr-ultrasound/checkpoint-25")

# Process image
image = Image.open("path/to/ultrasound.png")
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Post-process results
target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])
results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.5)
```
